# 	abstract = {Background  Rapid improvements in inexpensive, low-power, movement and environmental sensors have sparked a revolution in animal behavior research by enabling the creation of data loggers (henceforth, tags) that can capture fine-grained behavioral data over many months. Nevertheless, development of tags that are suitable for use with small species, for example, birds under 25 g, remains challenging because of the extreme mass (under 1 g ) and power (average current under 1µ   A) constraints. These constraints dictate that a tag should carry exactly the sensors required for a given experiment and the data collection protocol should be specialized to the experiment. Furthermore, it can be extremely challenging to design hardware and software to achieve the energy efficiency required for long tag life. Results  We present an activity monitor, BitTag, that can continuously collect activity data for 4–12 months at 0.5–0.8g , depending upon battery choice, and which has been used to collect more than 500,000 h of data in a variety of experiments. The BitTag architecture provides a general platform to support the development and deployment of custom sub-g tags. This platform consists of a flexible tag architecture, software for both tags and host computers, and hardware to provide the host/tag interface necessary for preparing tags for “flight” and for accessing tag data “postflight”. We demonstrate how the BitTag platform can be extended to quickly develop novel tags with other sensors while satisfying the 1g/1µ A mass and power requirements through the design of a novel barometric pressure sensing tag that can collect pressure and temperature data every 60s for a year with mass under 0.6g.},

I’m Jinlang Wang, a second year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by the wonderful [Tej Chajed](https://www.chajed.io/). I am broadly interested in formal verification, especially distributed systems verification. I use Forge to verify distributed protocols like 2pc and Paxos. Also, I am learning Dafny, Coq, and Iris.

## Personal

### Music

I like to play in an [ensemble](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ca4y1n71P/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=568c2816195794316da4f77c9822bebe), and I am always looking for people who are willing to play in an ensemble with me. My favorite composer is Franz Liszt, and I really like his [Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpEfHVFilRc&ab_channel=WBKids) (fun fact: Tom only has four fingers, so the producer had a pianist come to play with just four fingers, and then had Tom replicate the entire set) which took me half a year to master two-thirds of it. I hope to complete the final third when I have time... Yuja Wang is my favorite pianist, and we share the same hometown. I was very fortunate to see her [play in Orlando](https://parkavemagazine.com/event/yuja-wang-plays-rachmaninoff-jan-14/#:~:text=January%2014%2C%202023%20%40%207%3A,30%20pm%20%2D%209%3A30%20pm&text=Phillips%20Center.,with%20Rachmaninoff's%20First%20Piano%20Concerto!). 

### Movies
