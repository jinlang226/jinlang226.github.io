My amazing three-week graduation trip!

- went paragliding in Interlaken!!!! 
- really like Amsterdam (after London)
- went to the Van Gogh Museum!!!!!
- saw *Girl with a Pearl Earring*
- Switzerland's beautiful scenery reminded me of Guizhou, China
- went to Eisriesenwelt - the largest ice cave in the world
- watched the fireworks in Paris on France's National Day (pure coincidence)
- visited Cologne Cathedral
- experienced the joyful melody of DoReMi at the filming locations of the movie *The Sound of Music*
- visited the Mozart Museum and listened to *the Turkish March* on the harpsichord
