# 2024
## [Hundreds of Beavers](https://www.hundredsofbeavers.com/synopsis/)
I was fortunate to watch this movie. It was so funny.
## Before Trilogy
Sadly, my favorite one is the first.
## Little Woman
## Anatomy of a Fall
## Poor Things 
## The Holdovers
## Kung Fu Panda 4
## Deep Rising 2023(documentary)
## My Octopus Teacher
## The Pig, the Snake and the Pigeon(周处除三害)
惊艳，很久没看这么好的悬疑片了
